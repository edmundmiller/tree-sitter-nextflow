==================
Basic workflow declaration
==================

workflow {
    "Hello world"
}

(source_file
  (workflow_definition
    (workflow_body
      (string))))

==================
Workflow with input
==================

workflow {
    take:
        x
        y
    main:
        "Processing ${x} and ${y}"
}

      (workflow_input
        (identifier)
        (identifier))
      (workflow_main
        (string)))))

==================
Workflow with process calls
==================

workflow {
    PROCESS_A()
    PROCESS_B()
}

(source_file
  (workflow_definition
    (workflow_body
      (process_invocation

==================
Complete workflow definition
==================
