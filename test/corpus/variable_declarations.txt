==================
Basic variable declaration
==================

def x = 1

---

(source_file
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (number)))

==================
String variable declaration
==================

def greeting = 'Hello'

---

(source_file
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (string)))

==================
Multiple variable declarations
==================

def x = 1
def y = 2
def z = x + y

---

(source_file
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (number))
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (number))
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (binary_expression
      (identifier)
      (identifier))))

==================
Variable assignment
==================

x = 42

---

(source_file
  (assignment
    (identifier)
    (number)))

==================
Variable declaration with expression
==================

def result = Channel.from(1,2,3)

---

(source_file
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (channel_expression
      (channel_from
        (number)
        (number)
        (number)))))

==================
Variable declaration with list
==================

def numbers = [1, 2, 3]

---

(source_file
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (list
      (number)
      (number)
      (number))))

==================
Variable declaration with map
==================

def config = [foo: 'bar', count: 42]

---

(source_file
  (variable_declaration
    (identifier)
    (map
      (map_entry
        (identifier)
        (string))
      (map_entry
        (identifier)
        (number)))))
